# Virtual Environment

For this project, I used poetry to create my virtual environment and manage all dependencies.
It is always recommended to use virtual environment on your project.
For more information on poetry, see here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/

I found this YouTube video to be the best when using poetry in practice: https://youtu.be/0f3moPe_bhk?feature=shared
